So in this problem first I tried sql injection but it didnt work :(.
Then I tried using burpsuit to see if there's any information while requesting.
I did'nt find anything useful there, So I came back to the inspect page to see if there's anything hidden.
I found an intresting thread called secure.js which had the valid username and password.
I used it to get the flag :)
