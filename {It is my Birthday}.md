In the description of this level we can see that we need to make a md5 collision.
So after searching the google I got the website :

https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/

We now just need to download the two files and rename it as pdf extension.
After that we get re-directed to /index.php url.
Here we can find the flag in comment.
