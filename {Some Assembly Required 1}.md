First in this question, I went to inspect mode and saw there were some elements in it.

 ['value', '2wfTpTR', 'instantiate', '275341bEPcme', 'innerHTML', '1195047NznhZg', '1qfevql', 'input', '1699808QuoWhA', 'Correct!', 'check_flag', 'Incorrect!', './JIFxzHyW8W', '23SMpAuA', '802698XOMSrr', 'charCodeAt', '474547vVoGDO', 'getElementById', 'instance', 'copy_char', '43591XxcWUl', '504454llVtzW', 'arrayBuffer', '2NIQmVj', 'result']; 
{I tried to match it with the other elements but it didnt work :( }
There were two things that caught my eye which were : 'Correct!' and 'check_flag'.
But then I saw an extension given then I used the extension which downloaded a file in it was the flag.

Flag : picoCTF{cb688c00b5a2ede7eaedcae883735759}
