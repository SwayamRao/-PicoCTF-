In this lvl , I first saw working of the program which was a python file using python3 followed by filename.
It was not what displaying anything related to the flag so I went saw the code using cat command.
There I saw a code named bezos_cc_secret which seemed some kind of encrypted data or a cipher text.
Then I saw the reference of rot47, then I used the website dcode rot47 to decode it to get the flag.
