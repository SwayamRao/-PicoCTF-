Hi this is a walk through of some famous ctf's platform which are preety useful while learning ethical hacking or just general linux commands.
I would suggest not using walkthrough until u try the problem atleast once before going through the walkthrough.
I have written a bit about the description about the situation or command used just in case you dont understand.
Anyways Keep Learning :)
