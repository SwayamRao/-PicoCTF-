This was a 30 points level.
First I logged in to given ssh server and entered the given Password.
Then I used command "ls" to list the files and directory.
I found a file called 1of3.flag.txt
This by name means that there were 3 seperate text files containg the flag.
I used command "cat" to retrive the 1st part of the flag.
There was another file called instructions-to-2of3.txt 
I used command "cat" to retrive the information that the files might be in root directory.
I went to root directory and retrived all the 3 parts of flag.

Flag : picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_540e4e79}
