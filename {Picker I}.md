After analyzing the python code we get to know that the win function is function we are intrested in.
Whenever we give the value 'getRandomNumber' it will always print 4.
I made a flag.txt as it was said in the comment.
So we should use 'win' to call the function and the it will give the flag in hex.
After using a hex convertor we get the flag.
